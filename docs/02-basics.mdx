```
- Install VS Code and Extensions if not done yet. Please install the following extensions and then restart VSCode
 Live server, Tebnine, Auto Rename Tag,Bracket Pair Colorizer .Make sure AutoSave is on VSCode

- Create a folder called WriteYourSoftwareHere . This is where we will coding and putting all the projects
- Download and install the Zoom desktop version. Do not use the browser version.
- If you don't have a codepen account , open account

## Terminal Shortcuts - MAC
- Make directory - mkdir
- Where you are right -pwd
- files in this path --ls
- creating a file --touch filename
- able to go back and forth in folder cd ..
- able to go back to root --cd

- Windows User
- Creating a file - new-item
- Where you are right -dir
- files in this path -
- deleting - remove-item -recurse ( same for removing folder and file )t

#### SHORTCUT KEYS of VSCode
VSCode Shortcut is most underrated but most valuable skill to master.
Exact Feedback from the manager for a candidate received few days back .
```
We will pass on XXXX
We liked XXXX for his tenacity. Also, in face of a hard challenge he did not complain. These are good attributes and will lead him to a good job soon.Unfortunately, he was not fast enough and we are pushing for a high volume of code production. I am sure he will speed up in the future (perhaps even near future) - he just needs to work at it, but we need to know that our candidates are fast workers now. 

XXXX should also spend more time studying and using the latest frameworks. We still like him and wish him luck on his future endeavors.
Thank you, 
XXXX

Shortcut keys Show the person you are sharing that you are experienced.
Psychologically it's intimidating to the next person.
These will also speed up and help us code
### Common shortcut keys
- Moving line up and down 
- Copy line above and below 
- Deleting Lining 
- Commenting and uncommenting

### LESS COMMON
- Multi-Select and multi-line edit 
- Control Shift F to search the entire code --- This will be your most used command as an engineer.In most instances whatever story you are assigned has been done before, So all you have to do is a copy. For Copying, you need to search the entire code for keywords.
- Going to top and bottom of the Page - Real life components are so large that it will take forever to go up and down – PRODUCTION
- Fold and Unfold functions - PRODUCTION
For Ex: If your story is to change the font size of the header, You will search the entire code looking for the header to see all instances of it, make sure and apply changes.

```
Homework: Practice shortcut keys for at least 1 Hour. I don’t want to see anyone not using shortcut keys from tomorrow
Take VSCode and terminal short cut keys
```

### How does the page sections look like ? 

![](/img/basics/pagesections.png)

### Rules of H Tags
- Heading are very important for search engines and screen readers
- least one H1 for a search engine to know what is the title of the page 
- Do not skip headings. Ex H1 to H4.It should be logical 
- Use headers when need .
- Don’t just bold the text show the topic

### Lets see some H1 Tags
- Search for “best restro bar in nyc rooftop indian” Let's go to some results to tags.
- Not displayed in the browser. Carries metadata which describes data about this HTML page 

### Attributes
```
Ex: href , src,alt, style, lang, title
```

- Attributes provide additional information about HTML Elements
- In addition to standard attributes, you can attach anything  you want it to carry for example metadata

```
<a href="https://wynisco.com"> Go here</a>
```

- For opening a new window? What's the code?
- Security Concerns while opening new page 
```rel="noopener noreferrer" ``` 

Check browser support on caniuse.com
Let's see a live example 

### Absolute vs relative url 
Absolute 
```
<a href="https://wynisco.com">
```
### Relative
```
<a href="/camps">
```

If you are using relative how does the browser know how to direct? It uses whatever domain is on the address bar. 

Relative path preferred way. 
Difference between “/media/videos/1” vs “media/video/1”. It's a very common mistake where you might spend hours.

```
<img src=”buddy.jpeg” height=”30px” width=”10px” alt=”buddy_the_dog”/>
```

:::
Question : 
Why should you always assign height and width to the image ?
:::
Also, always define the width and height of images. This reduces flickering because the browser can reserve space for the image before loading.

Question : 
Why should you use alt in the image?
In case the image is not displayed alt tag will be shown and for browsers and screen readers to understand the image and also for SEO 
EXERCISE: ADD A IMAGE which when clicked should go to CNN
Be Careful there is a difference between
```
<a href="/camps/react"> and <a href="camps">
```
Typically don't use / if the directed link is in the same folder structure. Let's try this
LANG
```
<html lang=US />
```

### Country Code and Locales
Let's take at HTML code 
https://www.paypal.com/c2/smarthelp/home
https://www.paypal.com/us/smarthelp/home

- How do you write translations for different languages and locales? Paypal has a presence in over 150 countries.
- Look at the amount of metadata that HTML carries in PayPal

### i18n Localization and Globalization
- Look at theInternationalization is the process of designing and developing your software or mobile application product so it can be adapted and localized to different cultures, regions, and languages.
- Localization is the adaptation of your software, website content, or mobile application product to meet the language, culture, and other requirements of each locale.
